- Fills
    - have a menu to preset fill and give options for the roughness of the fill (only for shapes i.e. rectangles and circles)
    - polygon fills
        - user should be able to fill areas created by shapes/lines with certain fill
            - need to research into GPU based filling
            - polygons
                - cpu based triangulation
                - use gpu to fill those triangles
            - circles (?)
- Color Choice
    - We currently have preset colors, I want to have the user be able to use those preset colors as a base and custom configure them either using a color wheel or a color picker.

- Toolbar
    - Diamond Shape
